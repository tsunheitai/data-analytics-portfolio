# [Project 1: Bike Sharing Analysis](https://github.com/tsunheitai/Starter-projects/tree/main/Project%20-%20Bike%20Sharing%20Analysis)

Fictitious bike-share company in Chicago called Cyclistic wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. Public data from City of Chicago’s (“City”) Divvy bicycle sharing service was used to generate insights and data visualisations for this project. A report was generated using R Markdown which includes the code used throughout the data cleaning, manipulation, analysis and visualisation steps. This case study was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate.

The key findings from this project were:
1. Most casual riders ride on the weekends, whereas annual members ride most on the weekdays.
2. Casual riders have a far greater average ride duration compared to annual members.

# [Fun Project 1: FIFA 22 Data Analysis using SQL](https://github.com/tsunheitai/Starter-projects/tree/main/FIFA%2022%20Data%20Set)

Found a data set on Kaggle that has information such as player ratings and attributes that FIFA has given each player in FIFA 22. I like playing FIFA, so I'm including this here and also to show the SQL queries I ran to get the information I wanted from this data.
